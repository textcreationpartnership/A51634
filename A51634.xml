         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>TOGETHER, With ſome Brief <hi>Notes</hi> and <hi>Obſervations</hi> on the <hi>LAWS</hi> and Adminiſtration, in Relation to That <hi>DUTY;</hi> And the Partiality and Inequality thereof.</p>
            </argument>
            <byline>By <hi>ROBERT M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RRAY,</hi> Gent'.</byline>
            <p>THE former <hi>Laws of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe</hi> enioyns the Payment of <hi>Two Shillings</hi> and <hi>Six Pence,</hi> upon every <hi>Barrel of</hi> BEER and ALE, above <hi>Six Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;</hi> and <hi>Six Pence,</hi> for every <hi>Barrel of</hi> BEER &amp; ALE, of <hi>Six Shillings,</hi> or under; the <hi>Common Brewer</hi> to make his Entry weekly; <hi>Inn-holders, Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allers,</hi> and <hi>Ale-houſe-keepers,</hi> per Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſem, under the ſeveral Penalties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mentioned.</p>
            <p>THAT, notwithſtanding theſe <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries</hi> are duly Made and Atteſted, the <hi>Officer</hi>'s ſingle Evidence is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, and his Charge (though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo unreaſonable) muſt be paid; and the <hi>Brewer</hi> is not admitted to Diſcharge himſelf, though, by the expreſs Letter of the Statute, he is allowed ſo to do; the <hi>Gauger</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up his Charge by <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Cold Worts,</hi> in the <hi>Tun</hi> or <hi>Backs;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are over-charg'd One <hi>Sixth part,</hi> at leaſt: Whereas the <hi>Duty,</hi> chargeable by <hi>Law</hi> only, is, on every <hi>Barrel of</hi> BEER and ALE, ſold and delivered out; and the Allowances of <hi>Two Barrels of Ale,</hi> upon every <hi>Twenty-Two;</hi> and <hi>Three Barrels of
<pb facs="tcp:39108:2"/>Beer,</hi> upon every <hi>Twenty-three Barrels,</hi> are in Conſideration only of Damage, by <hi>Filling up, Yeaſt,</hi> and <hi>Waſt,</hi> in Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; which doth not neither fully anſwer: And, in all Places out of this <hi>City,</hi> the <hi>Officers</hi> Charge <hi>That</hi> for ALE, which is really BEER; which is One <hi>Eight Part</hi> more than the <hi>Law</hi> requires, to the Oppreſſion of the Country; By which means, the whole Burthen of this <hi>Tax</hi> is laid upon a <hi>Fourth Part</hi> of the People; which cannot otherwiſe be Remedied, but by Changing this <hi>Duty</hi> from <hi>Mault</hi>-DRINKS, to MAULT; Whereby every Man will pay in an equal Proportion, to the Strength and Goodneſs of what they conſume.</p>
            <p>IF any ſhould be hereby Diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from Brewing their own <hi>Drink,</hi> the KING will be Reprized in the <hi>Exciſe,</hi> on the <hi>Common Brewer;</hi> who will be a conſiderable Gainer, by the Augmentation of his Trade: <hi>Eight Pence</hi> laid on every <hi>Buſhel of</hi> MAULT, allowing <hi>Three Buſhels</hi> to every <hi>Barrel of</hi> BEER, and ALE, which is all allowed <hi>per Barrel</hi> for ALE and BEER of Common Draft and Sale, will Reduce the preſent <hi>Duty</hi> from <hi>Four Shillings</hi> and <hi>Nine Pence per Barrel,</hi> to <hi>Two Shillings;</hi> and yet encreaſe that Revenue to, at leaſt, <hi>Fifteen Hundred Thouſand Pounds;</hi> which is <add>= dou</add>ble, to what it now brings in to the <hi>Government;</hi> and the <hi>Nation</hi> conſiderably Eaſed, the <hi>Number of Officers</hi> Leſſened, and above a <hi>Moiety of the Charge of Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> Saved to the <hi>Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Redreſs the Grievance and Extortion afore-ſaid, and Regulate the Entries and Charge againſt the <hi>Brewers,</hi> according to the true Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Laws of Exciſe,</hi> it would much abate the Revenue.</p>
            <p>IF the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould lay an <hi>Additional Exciſe</hi> on BEER and ALE, the <hi>Brewers</hi> would have a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereby; for, where <hi>Nine Pence</hi> was added upon a <hi>Barrel of Strong</hi> BEER and ALE, and <hi>Three Pence</hi> upon <hi>Small,</hi> the <hi>Exciſe</hi> little Advanced; and, when it was off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, it was as little abated: So that, any Addition to, or Regulation of <hi>Exciſe,</hi> as Now it is, will prove of little or no Advantage to the <hi>Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THOSE <hi>Brewers,</hi> that wet great Quantities of MAULT, ſave <hi>Five Pounds per</hi> Week, by <hi>Exciſe:</hi> ſome more, ſome leſs.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Duty</hi> falling upon the <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> Rank of Men (the <hi>Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> and <hi>Wealthier ſort,</hi> who Brew their own <hi>Drink,</hi> being exempt) is an Hardſhip, might as well be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their <hi>Bread,</hi> as to their <hi>Drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Exemption of thoſe that
<pb facs="tcp:39108:2"/>Brew for their Private Uſe, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, will occaſion many to do it, and more will follow the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; by which the <hi>Revenue</hi> muſt be leſſened, and precarious.</p>
            <p>THAT the <hi>Revenue of Exciſe,</hi> as it Now ſtands, is little better than precarious, appears partly from the myſterious Practices of <hi>Brewers,</hi> very hard, if not impoſſible to prevent; who always have it in their Power to Augment or Leſſen the ſame, by Brewing ſometimes <hi>One, Two, Three</hi> or <hi>Four Barrels,</hi> out of the ſame Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of MAULT; where they often pay <hi>Five Shillings</hi> to the <hi>Crown,</hi> when they ought to account for <hi>Ten Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;</hi> and partly, from the encreaſe of <hi>Private Brewing;</hi> to which the Temptation will grow, if the <hi>Duty</hi> be Augmented, unleſs Reſtrained by a Particular Clauſe; and ſhould ſuch <hi>Private Brewing</hi> become a General Practice, the whole <hi>Revenue</hi> would be entirely loſt.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore <hi>Propoſed,</hi> That the <hi>Duty of Exciſe</hi> may be changed from <hi>Mault</hi>-DRINKS unto MAULT, for the Reaſons enſuing:</p>
            <p>ALL that <hi>Drink,</hi> whether Rich or Poor, Brewing for themſelves or not, will pay in an equal Proportion, to the Strength, and Goodneſs, of what they Conſume.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Revenue</hi> will this way be Encreaſed, and yet the <hi>People</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably Eaſed.</p>
            <p>THE Duty, thus laid, may be Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Collected, without diſpute, between the KING, and the <hi>People;</hi> which wil be an equal Service to the <hi>Former,</hi> and Satisfaction to the <hi>Latter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Revenue</hi> will thus be fix'd, and certain, and not ſubject to be impaired by any Arts, as now.</p>
            <p>AND, whereas it may be objected, That the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and <hi>Gentry,</hi> who keep great Hoſpitality, will hereby be much burthened by the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the EXCISE to MAULT. <hi>For Anſwer; One Moiety</hi> of the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> EXCISE, being Given the <hi>Crown,</hi> in Recompence of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Wards,</hi> &amp;c. taken away 12 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. in Eaſe of the ſaid <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> who were only grieved by that <hi>Court;</hi> the Equivalent in Honour might well enough have been charged on Themſelves, and the <hi>People</hi> have been quite Exempted; who were in nothing Eaſed, by taking away the <hi>Court of Wards;</hi> at leaſt, it ſeems high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt, that They bear their Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Part with the <hi>People;</hi> which is done by this Expedient.</p>
            <p>THAT This is a more equal <hi>Tax,</hi> and may be managed without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting their Houſes to the Inſpection of <hi>Exciſe-men;</hi> which will obviate the Common <hi>Objection,</hi> againſt Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:39108:3"/>the <hi>Duty</hi> from <hi>Mault</hi>-DRINKS to MAULT; and the putting the ſame at <hi>Eight Pence per Buſhel,</hi> will Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the <hi>Exciſe of Drink</hi> to <hi>Two Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings per Barrel,</hi> which now pays <hi>Four Shillings</hi> and <hi>Nine Pence;</hi> and yet <add>= = dou</add>ble the preſent Revenue; and will be Collected at a little more than <hi>One Third</hi> Part of the now Charges; the Sallaries of many <hi>Superfluous Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi> being ſaved, amounting to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Thouſand Pounds per Annum:</hi> Nor is MAULT, by any Conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſubject to ſo many Frauds, it taking up <hi>Eighteen</hi> or <hi>Twenty</hi> Days Time, after Wetting, before it can be fit for Sale: And the MAULTSTERS being, for the moſt part, Wealthy, the <hi>Duty</hi> will be as Currently paid, and as well, if not better ſecured, as from the BREWER.</p>
            <p>THAT This, alone, will be a Fund ſufficient to take off all Anticipations on this <hi>Duty,</hi> in the <hi>Exchecquer,</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe a <hi>General Exciſe,</hi> and other <hi>pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit Impoſitions;</hi> as That on <hi>Glaſs, Earthen-Ware, Coals,</hi> &amp;c. which may be thought Grievous; and will ſerve the <hi>Government</hi> to ſupport the <hi>War,</hi> during the Continuance thereof; and help to take-in <hi>Clipt</hi> and <hi>Light Money,</hi> and totally free all future <hi>Impoſitions</hi> upon <hi>Land: One Fourth</hi> Part of the ſaid Duty on MAULT, ſettled on the <hi>Crown</hi> for ever, will be an Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, in lieu of that Part of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,</hi> that is Hereditary; and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſettled on the <hi>Crown</hi> for <hi>Ten Years,</hi> or during the Continuance of the <hi>War,</hi> will be found a Fund ſufficient for <hi>Fifteen Millions; viz.</hi> Raiſe <hi>Three Millions</hi> the firſt <hi>Five Years,</hi> or <hi>Five Millions</hi> for <hi>Three Years,</hi> (beſides the ordinary Revenue of the Crown;) which may be Extinguiſhed in Ten Years: And that ſuch a <hi>Settlement</hi> for <hi>This,</hi> or the like <hi>Term of Years,</hi> to Support and Carry on the <hi>War,</hi> for ſome Continuance; will contribute very much to the Abatement of the Pride and Courage of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>FROM the <hi>Whole,</hi> 'Tis not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, by This PAPER, to Propoſe the Laying a <hi>New Impoſition on Mault;</hi> but to Leſſen what ſeems already (tho' not <hi>Directly,</hi> yet <hi>Remotely</hi>) Charg'd on it, by Reducing the ſame from <hi>Twelve Shillings</hi> and <hi>Eight Pence, per Quarter,</hi> to <hi>Five Shillings</hi> and <hi>Four Pence;</hi> for ſo, in Effect, it now Payes: For <hi>Six Buſhels,</hi> making <hi>Two Barrels</hi> of BEER and ALE, is <hi>Nine Shillings</hi> &amp; <hi>Six Pence;</hi> and the other <hi>Two Buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els,</hi> being a <hi>Third</hi> Part more, is <hi>Three Shillings</hi> and <hi>Two Pence;</hi> which makes <hi>Twelve Shillings</hi> and <hi>Eight Pence, per Quarter.</hi> And it is humbly ſubmitted, That it may be much better, to Lay an <hi>Exciſe</hi> on <hi>One</hi> Single <hi>Commodity,</hi> which affects <hi>All</hi> in General; than a <hi>General Exciſe</hi> on <hi>All Commodities.</hi>
